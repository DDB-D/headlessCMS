This website is built using a combination of HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript, WebGL, Jekyll, Ruby, Markdown, and Liquid, is version-controlled using Git on GitHub and is hosted on Netlify, a popular platform for deploying static websites. 
The website uses several JavaScript libraries, including jQuery for DOM manipulation, Flowtype.js for responsive typography, Lettering.js for web typography, CircleType.js for circular text, Shuffle Text for text effects, OGL for WebGL, Paper.js for vector graphics, Simplex Noise for noise generation, and lazysizes for lazy loading of images.
The website also includes IndieAuth for decentralized identity, and has links to my Mastodon and email for identity verification.
The website uses Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby. Its content is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language.
Overall, this site uses a modern, JavaScript-heavy stack with a focus on performance and typography. It's built with a static site generator, making it fast and secure. The use of version control and a popular hosting platform ensures that the website is maintainable and reliably hosted.
