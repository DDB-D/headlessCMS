About

{:.project_txt}
The multi-lingual campaign is addressed to parents and people looking after
young children, and aims to avoid misuse of liquid laundry detergent capsules.
The website is featuring a video, infographics, articles and a photo gallery in
26 languages. I designed the website and the infographics which where then
produced by an illustrator.
