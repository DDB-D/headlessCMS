About

{:.project_txt}
CDLX Mono is a simple and clear geometric monospaced typeface. It was originally buildt for tables, code, formulas and other data driven typographic needs but also works well for professionally set copytext. CDLX Mono comes in three weights (light, regular, bold) and with italics as an Unicode encoded opentype font (otf). It contains the Latin-Standards and specific characters like arrows, geometric shapes, textures and ligatures.
