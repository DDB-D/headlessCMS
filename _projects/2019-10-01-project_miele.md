About

{:.project_txt}
Global campaign website celebrating the market launch of the G7000
dishwasher with inspirational content and unique imagery.
As an integral touchpoint of the marketing funnel the website had
to be delivered in time for the IFA opening.
Working with an interdisciplinary team I was in charge for
the design of the website, coordinating and instructing
the team, as well as communicating with the client.
