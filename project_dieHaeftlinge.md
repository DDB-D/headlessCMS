600 jewish prisoners where deported from KZ Stutthof near Danzig to the
subcamp in Hailfingen/Tailfingen. This camp existed from November 1944 to
February 1945. Within those three month nearly a third of the prisoners died.
It took years of research by Volker Mall, Harald Roth und Johannes Kuhn to
reconstruct the pathes of suffering. This book tries to restore the names
and the dignity of the dead and the survivors through pieces of evidence,
biographical research and photos.
