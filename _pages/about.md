Hi, my name is Holger and I am a german interactive and graphic designer. 
With more than 10 years of experience, I’ve worked with design studios and ad agencies in Berlin, Düsseldorf and Stuttgart. 
I create websites, digital campaigns, creative concepts, visual identities, animations, typefaces, prototypes and everything in between. 
I offer support and advice for agencies, enterprises and institutions in regard to UI and UX, branding, advertising, content creation, digital tooling and much more.
My approach lies in the creation of rule based systems with considerations of constraints, not only caring about how things look but also how they work.
Understanding myself as a problem solver I approach a job with a pragmatic and solution-oriented mindset and an efficient workflow.
