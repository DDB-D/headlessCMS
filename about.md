Hi, my name is Holger and I’m a graphic & interactive designer. With more than 10 years of experience, I’ve worked with design studios and ad agencies in Berlin, Düsseldorf and Stuttgart. I create websites, digital campaigns, creative concepts, visual identities, animations, typefaces, prototypes and everything in between. Besides my passion for design I enjoy listening to (really)good music, play a game of chess and go skateboarding with the homies.
