KI.NRW is the central point of contact for artificial intelligence in North Rhine-Westphalia.
KI.NRW supports the transformation of North Rhine-Westphalia into a nationwide leading location for applied artificial intelligence (AI). The aim is to accelerate the transfer of AI from cutting-edge research to industry, to establish a model region for professional qualification in AI and to promote the social dialog about AI. In doing so, KI.NRW places people and their ethical principles at the center of the design of artificial intelligence
